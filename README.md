A smart financial assistant powered by artificial intelligence



```
System name: Smart Finance AI





Objective: To create an intelligent system that automatically searches, analyzes, and sorts information about profitable and useful financial instruments  and then generates personalized recommendations for users





Project Objectives
1.Implement the collection and aggregation of data from reliable sources (banks, exchanges, investment platforms, open APIs)

2.Provide intelligent data analysis using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods

3.Develop a module for sorting and filtering financial instruments by criteria (profitability, risk, maturity, reliability)

4.Implement a mechanism for personalized recommendations based on the user's profile and preferences

5.Create a user-friendly interface (web/mobile application) for interacting with the system

6.Ensure the security of user data





Functional requirements:
1.Registration and authorization (including via social media/bank accounts)

2.Completing your profile: financial goals, risk level, investment period, preferences

3.Viewing current financial instruments (list, cards, table)

4.Receive AI recommendations (personalized and general)

5.Filter and sort tools

6.Save your favorites

7.Receive notifications about new deals.





Non-functional requirements:
1.Performance: Processing large volumes of data in real time

2.Scalability: Ability to add new sources and features

3.Reliability: Failure protection and data backup

4.Security: Encryption of personal data, two-factor authentication

5.Interface: Intuitive, cross-platform (web + mobile)





Architecture and technology:
1.Backend: Python (Django/FastAPI)

2.AI/ML: TensorFlow, scikit-learn

3.Frontend: React / Flutter

4.DB: PostgreSQL, Redis

5.Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes





Design model:
1.The Waterfall model is used to implement the project

2.Requirements analysis – collecting and formalizing system requirements

3.Design – creating the system architecture, database, and interfaces

4.Implementation (coding) – developing individual modules (data collection, AI, interface)

5.Testing – modular, integration, and load testing

6.implementation – installing and launching the system for users.

7.Maintenance – bug fixes, updates, and improvements.





Implementation Stages

1.Requirements Analysis and Specification Creation

2.System Design (Architecture, Databases)

3.Module Implementation:

4.Data Collection

5.Analysis and Sorting

6.Recommender System

7.User Interface

8.Testing

9.Pilot Version Implementation

10.Maintenance and Development
